    "# **Tâche #2 - Questions-réponses avec un modèle QA extractif**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cette tâche consiste à utiliser un modèle de question-réponse extractif de type transformer afin de repérer des informations dans un texte. Vous utilisez la librairie HuggingFace pour accomplir cette tâche. On demande plus spécifiquement d’utiliser le modèle *bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad*.\n",
    "\n",
    "La tâche a pour but précis de repérer 3 informations dans les descriptions textuelles : le lieu et la date de l’incident ainsi qu’un court passage de texte indiquant ce qui s’est passé.  Une partie importante de votre travail consiste à trouver de bonnes formulations de questions pour repérer ces informations. Le fichier *t2_qa_examples*.json, qui contient 25 exemples annotés par un humain, est disponible pour mener vos expérimentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Les consignes pour cette tâche sont:\n",
    "-\tNom du notebook : *t2_qa.ipynb* (ce notebook)\n",
    "-\tTokenisation et plongements de mots : Ceux du modèle utilisé.\n",
    "-\tNormalisation : Aucune normalisation à faire (le tokeniseur convertit les lettres en minuscule).\n",
    "-\tConstruction du modèle : vous utilisez la version préentraînée du modèle sans modification. Aucun affinement (fine-tuning) du modèle n’est requis pour cette tâche.\n",
    "-\tÉvaluation : Du code est disponible dans le notebook pour évaluer la performance du modèle avec les métriques *exact match* et *F1*.\n",
    "-\tAnalyse : Présentez et discutez des résultats que vous obtenez pour les 3 types d’informations à repérer. Discutez également de vos choix de questions pour accomplir cette tâche et les erreurs commises par le modèle QA."

      "Contexte:  At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr \n",

      "Texte :  At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr \n",

They scraped the interiors of the  building and collected debris as they finished up the job. On August 28  2012   at approximately 10:00 a.m  the job assignment was done and every employee was  to put away all the rubble and gather all equipment in order to pack up and  leave the site. When the job assignment was finished  it is typical for all  employees to gather everything and put it away into the garbage bin or in  their trailers and bins. At the time  four coworkers were outside in the  parking lot working near the Number 5 700 Panther. Two coworkers were going to  load the number 5 700 Panther and Employee #1 stated that he was going to load  the number 5 700 Panther on a trailer when their trailer returns from the trip  delivering their first load. This worker got on a Gradall machine to lift a  box bin and move it towards the number 5 700 Panther. The coworkers stated  that Employee #1  not the employee designated to drive the Panther  got on  this vehicle and started driving it. Employee #1 attempted to load a number  5 700 Panther on to a bin. This bin had a rubber lip with a four to five inch  incline ramp on its lip's edge. Employee #1 drove the Panther straight  backwards on the bin and did not go through this four to five inch ramp bump  on to the bin. Right after this unsuccessful attempt  Employee #1 drove it  backwards a second time except this time slightly slanted to his left side.  The left wheel touched the ramp first. On this second attempt  the number  5 700 Panther fell and flipped over. Employee #1 attempted to jump out of this  vehicle but was unable to get away as the Panther which weighed over 2 000  pounds fell on his left foot and pinned it. A coworker got the Gradall  machinery in order to remove the Panther that was on top of Employee #1's left  foot. Employee #1 suffered a serious fracture injury to his left leg and was  hospitalized over twenty-four hours. Employee #1 also stated that he is well  trained in driving other construction vehicle equipment by another foreman.     \n",

      "Texte :  On August 24  2003  Jose Crespin Company  a stucco contractor  employed  Employee #1 and four coworkers. They were applying a stucco finish to the  exterior insulating finishing system on the Home Depot  Store Number 6555.  After completing the lumber canopy at the west end of the building  the  employees moved to the east end to finish the exterior insulating finishing  system on the spandrel panels at the garden center. While waiting for the  building surface to cool  the employees took a work break. During their break   the weather swiftly changed from clear and sunny to heavy rain and strong  winds. The employees then moved to the north side of the building at the  garden center where they hoped that the masonry piers and spandrel panels  would shelter them from the rain. The wind reached speeds in excess of 40 mph  and began collapsing the masonry piers (C.1-0.2 and C.1-0.3) where the  employees were standing. Realizing the imminent danger of the collapsing  piers  four employees fled from the area. Employee #1 became entangled in a  sheet of plastic  and was unable to break free when stub pier \"C.1-0.3\"  a  14-foot tall masonry pier  collapsed on him  crushing him. He was killed from  asphyxia.                                                                       \n",

They were doing this while the  cement slurry backfill was being poured between the excavation wall and the  north wall of the inlet structure.

He sustained numerous bodily injuries. The coworker was able to climb  out safely.                                                                     \n",
